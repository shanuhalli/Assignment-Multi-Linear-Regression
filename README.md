## Multiple linear regression :
Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable. You can use multiple linear regression when you want to know:

  1. How strong the relationship is between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable (e.g. how rainfall, temperature, and amount of fertilizer added affect crop growth).

  2. The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variables (e.g. the expected yield of a crop at certain levels of rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer addition).
